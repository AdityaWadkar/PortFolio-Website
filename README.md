## 🚀 Brief Idea
A portfolio website is a unique way to showcase your work and let others know about yourself. It’s like an evergreen platform for your projects, case studies, and information about you. In addition, it’s one of the best ways to express your personality, experience, and capabilities.

A portfolio website presents your professionalism and dedication to the craft better and more clearly than any CV. You don’t just tell, you show actual cases and examples which speak volumes. Moreover, owing to the portfolio website, you can show your mature and sophisticated approach to selling your work along with yourself.
